# Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study

#### My Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project

## Introduction

Cyclistic is a fictional company that launched a successful bike-sharing in 2016. Since then, the program has grown into a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
In this case study I will demonstrate the entire process of data analysis using Google principles which are: 
**Ask, Prepare, Process,Analyze, Share,** and **Act**

## Scenario

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Characters and teams
● **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

● **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for
the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
These may include email, social media, and other channels.
